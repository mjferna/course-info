Debriefing for final project

Code and Poetry

Matt Fernandez

###Objectives for the project:

- Create a course that relates to "Code and Poetry" (thinking critically our computing practices) but the reflects the kind of skillset I could foreseeably have in the near-future.
- Incorporate elements of my professional training in American literature (this would also help get the course to fulfill some type of "American literature" requirement, depending on the department).
- Introduce some of the debates in the digital humanities/computational criticism.
- Make the course accessible to lower-level undergraduates.

###Steps toward achieving those objectives:

- Think more historically, rather than philosophically (as we did in "Code and Poetry"), about the problems of computing. Harness the specialities of English departments (especially book history) to inform our computing practices. Contexualize our computing practices.
- Create a lab that focuses heavily on computing with the lecture/seminar component dealing mostly with history.

###Problems:

- Obviously, there's only so much you can include in a 13-week period especially because this is a broad topic. The hardest part was choosing which types of texts to focus on. I tried to choose ones that were most related to the course as well as drawing upon the resources here. Furthermore, I attempted to focus on topics that related to Columbia/New York City (since this is one the requirements when submitting a course proposal here).

- How technical to get in the labs. The students who are entering universities now are increasingly more tech-savvy as schools and parents are now encouraging their kids to learn the basics of programming. I factored this into my labs. That said, I wanted this to accessible to all students. My solution right now is to create a final project that requires students to gain a deeper understanding of one of the technical topics in the course (terminal, Python, GIS, cloud computing, etc).


###Evaluation:

- I think I fulfilled my objectives, at least for now. To teach this course, though, I still believe I need to further my technical/computing/statistical abilities. One of the ways to accomplish is to take a course like "Computing in Context" but more coursework will need to be completed.
