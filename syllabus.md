## Course Description

"Man Thinking must not be subdued by his instruments."

- Ralph Waldo Emerson, 1837

Although we utilize a plethora of different media each day, many of us take for granted the technologies that allow us do so. Likewise, we do not necessarily associate innovations like writing, the printing press, etc., as technologies in the same vein as computers. In the current age of computing, where we spend many hours reading and writing behind a screen each day, understanding how these technologies work is becoming increasingly critical to be informed citizens.

The goal of this class is to analyze the interplay between media and society as a way to better understand our contemporary computing practices. In the process, students will gain hands-on experience with a diverse array of everyday technological instruments. We will do this by establishing a broad, theoretical framework and then proceed to investigate older media in a series case studies. By the end of semester, we will specifically turn our attention to key concepts in humanities computing.

Secondly, this course will provide students with a technical foundation for future studies in the digital humanities. The labs in the course are designed to ensure students gain a measure of computational proficiency and promote experimentation with a range of different technologies.

Lastly, we will look at a number of canonical authors while integrating concepts in a diverse range of fields, including literary studies, history, media studies, communication, and computer science. To this end, we will consider material objects within their social contexts.
