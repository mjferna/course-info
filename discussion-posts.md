===============

Each week you'll be expected to write up at least one short post (no more than a paragraph) about the readings assigned that week. Think about these posts in the same way you might think about posting to a real message board or Reddit. The goal is the foster discussion by asking questions and creating points of entry into the readings, not to a formulate a complex theories or demonstrate your mastery over the readings. Be concise. You will also be expected to respond to at least one comment.
