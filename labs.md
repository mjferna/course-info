Labs and Lab Notebook
============

**Labs**
Labs are aimed at bettering our own computing practices while providing a short introduction to some of tools of the digital humanities.

You'll be assigned to a different lab group with around ~3 people. Use your lab partners as a resource for help.

**Lab Notebooks**
Use your lab notebooks to take notes during labs. They'll be collected at the end of the semester, but they are primarily for your future use.
